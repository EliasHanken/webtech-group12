# webtech-group12

The intention with this project is to create a webpage
for a bike renting company located in Ã…lesund

To run this webpage with the backend you need to open
the webpage with this link:
https://group12-bike-rental.netlify.app/index.html
This will the work if the server is live. 
You must also be connected to NTNU network or use a 
VPN to connect to it.

If you want to run the frontend only all you need to do
is open the project in an IDE and open it from there or
open the index file from the pulled folder. The Carousel
will not be visible however since it connects to the backend.
